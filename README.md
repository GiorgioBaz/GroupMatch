## Description
Made to address the needs of students at UTS struggling to find groups with the same mindset and goals.

This application utilises a familiar Tinder-based design to match students with peers who have like-minded goals for subjects.

It aims to do this through a simple yes or no decision that students make depending on their peer's previous academic results and goals for the current subject.

Made with MongoDB, Express, React, Node and a bit of love â™¡
